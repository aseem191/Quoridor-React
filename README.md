My recreation of the board game Quoridor made using React/Redux and MongoDB, with a strategy-uncovering twist!


This repository contains my React project code. server.js contains my backend REST API that communicates with an mLab MongoDB database.


This game involves 2 players, and is played online. The app features a constantly updating game board, automatic database cleanup, and an alert system that notifies players of possible strategies drawn from winning board arrangements, creating a metagame where players work with the app to try and guess the other player's motives.


Screenshot of the game in action:
