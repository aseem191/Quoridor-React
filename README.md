My recreation of the board game Quoridor made using React and MongoDB, with a strategy-uncovering twist! Visit https://reactquoridor.now.sh/ to use the app!


This repository contains the project code. server.js contains backend code that communicates with an mLab MongoDB database.


Screenshot of the game in action:
